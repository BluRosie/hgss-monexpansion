# hgss-monexpansion
 looking into mon expansion in english heart gold

## build everything
put your arm9 in the root directory as arm9.bin

put your overlay 1 in the root directory as overlay9_0001.bin

put your overlay 18 in the root directory as overlay9_0018.bin

extract a180_0.bin (extract it from narc a180) and put it in the root directory as a180_0.bin.  this is done to preserve frame animation data for each mon

put your heart gold rom in the text/ folder as "base.nds"

put your a081 narc in the root folder as a081.narc (the output will overwrite this)

run scripts/make.bat in the root directory

replace all the generated files with their equivalents in the rom.  specifics can be seen below



### make the mon sprite data
run scripts/makemonspritenarc.bat in the root directory

insert narc a004 over top of the previous one

make sure that the image is png-24 format.  (decrease the color depth to 256)

credits to goodri63 here on github for his GenIVSpriteReplacer which i modified to turn it into a number of command line tools

insert arm9.bin back into the rom (make sure to recompress it in ct2) as well as narc a020 over top of what was previously there

### make the mon footprint narc
this one i just chose to not deal with the lz10 compression.  no edits can currently be made, but i put blank footprints in for plenty of new pok√©mon.  will make editable in a while.

run scripts/makefootprintnarc.bat in the root directory

insert narc a069 over top of what was previously there

### make the mon height table
run scripts/makeheighttable.bat in the root directory

insert narc a005 over top of what was previously there

extract a180_0.bin (extract it from narc a180) and put it in the root directory as a180_0.bin.  this is done to preserve frame animation data for each mon

TODO:  make a tool for visualizing this?

### make the regional dex order
run scripts/makeregionaldexorder.bat in the root directory

insert narc a138 over top of what was previously there

### make all the text related changes
specifically the things like the mon names, dex descriptions, weight, height, and dex categories

put your heart gold rom in the text/ folder as "base.nds"

run scripts/makemsgnarc.bat in the root directory

insert narc a027 over top of what was previously there

credits to loadingNOW for his tool, thenewpoketext.  had to modify the binary to make it apply to hgss specifically, but it works alright

### make all the overworld btx0 files
images don't need to be indexed

put your arm9 in the root directory as arm9.bin

put your overlay 1 in the root directory as overlay9_0001.bin

put your a081 narc in the root folder as a081.narc (the output will overwrite this, but needs it nonetheless)

add templates to the end of the above file, a081.  these can be found in rawdata/overworldtemplates.  for example, if i'm adding in a small pokemon, then i need to add in a smallmon template to the end of the file.

run scripts/makeoverworldnarc.sh in the root directory.  this one currently requires wsl (cygwin or msys2 might work too), sadly

insert narc a081 over top of what was previously there.  do the same with narc a141, arm9.bin, overlay9_0001.bin, and a028_0.bin (insert it over the 0th file in narc a028).

note that the \*\_shiny.png files are there solely for their palettes

credits to KazoWAR for his tool that he updated in 2018, btx editor.  modified it to be a command line tool
