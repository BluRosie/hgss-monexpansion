credits to loadingNOW for his tool, thenewpoketext.  had to modify the binary to make it apply to hgss specifically, but it works alright

images don't need to be indexed

put your arm9 in the root directory as arm9.bin

put your a081 narc in the root folder as a081.narc (the output will overwrite this, but needs it nonetheless)

run scripts/makeoverworldnarc.bat in the root directory.

insert narc a081 over top of what was previously there.  do the same with narc a141, arm9.bin, overlay9_0001.bin, and a028_0.bin (insert it over the 0th file in narc a028).

note that the \*\_shiny.png files are there solely for their palettes

credits to KazoWAR for his tool that he updated in 2018, btx editor.  modified it to be a command line tool that very specifically works with this project.

### make all the mon cries
currently, the sound directory contains wav files of each of the pokemon gens 1-5.  edit as you please

run scripts\makecries.bat in the root directory

copy gs_sound_data.sdat from the rawdata folder.  this is slightly modified gs_sound_data that has spaces for pokemon up to index 900

using nitro studio (the tool by gota7), open the sdat file and the "Wave Archive" folder and replace WAVE_ARC_PV544 and up with each new cry swar
for example, WAVE_ARC_PV544 is going to be 544.swar in the swar folder that was created in the sound/ directory

in the future, i will provide one with all the pokemon that have data

credits to Barro, ProfessorDoktorGamer, and Gota7 for swav2swar, wav2sav, and nitro studio respectively
